But the main fuked up thing comes when he literally have sex with that girl when she turns 9 year old and for fucksake she wasn't even mature at that time that she can bear child and it is in our hadith, that no child came from that 9 year old girl in her whole lifetime..... So why the fuck that old man had sex with that 9 year old... How could it probably help Islam to be spread..... I'm done",

They don\u2019t know yet and I definitely don\u2019t plan on telling them. I\u2019m really excited to finally live life on my own terms but I also feel extremely anxious and sad. I know I\u2019ll be breaking my dad\u2019s heart specifically and it\u2019s hurting me. I know this is the right decision for me because if I stay, it means getting pressured into an arranged marriage (im a South Asian F in her late 20s) and even if I somehow dodge arranged marriage, my relationship with them is getting extremely strained and worse by the day. Yet, I feel guilty and selfish. I\u2019m also leaving my job with no notice because I don\u2019t want word getting out in advance. I want to try and rebuild my relationship with them eventually or at least retain my relationship with my sibling. Should I tell them which country I move to without giving any specific details about whereabouts? Or do I keep it vague like \u201cI\u2019m in Europe\u201d? \n\nAny words of advice or motivation would really help\u2026",
